# bouncing ball

A ball that bounces on lines...  
The balls also bounce with eachother.

Controls :
- place a new line : left click to set the two extremeties points.
- spawn a ball : spacebar or right click
- remove the last line : backspace
- place a spawner that creates a ball every second: Z
- remove the last spawner: 
- activate gravity: G
- open the menu: press A
  while in the menu, use the sliders to control (respectively, from top to bottom):
  - the balls' bounciness (how much speed they loose on impact)
  - the balls' size
- exit the program : escape

Maybe I will put other mathematically complex projects here...
