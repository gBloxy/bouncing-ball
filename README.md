# bouncing ball

A ball that bounce on lines...  
The balls also bounce between them.

Controls :
- place a new line : left click two times to set the two extremeties points.
- spawn a ball : spacebar or right click
- remove the last placed line : backspace
- exit the program : escape

Maybe I will put here other mathematically complex projects...
